// This schema can be adapted to different industries by enabling/disabling specific fields
// For example, the 'securityClearance' field is specific to the security industry
// The 'medicalLicense' field is specific to the healthcare industry
// The 'constructionCertification' field is specific to the construction industry
// The 'deliveryLicense' field is specific to the delivery industry
// The 'hospitalityCertification' field is specific to the hospitality industry
// The 'retailExperience' field is specific to the retail industry
// The 'manufacturingExperience' field is specific to the manufacturing industry

Please note that this is a basic schema and it might need to be extended based on specific project requirements. For example, you might need to add more fields or create additional schemas to represent other entities in your application. Also, error handling and validation are not included in this schema, they should be handled in your application logic.
