## Compliance Setup Guides

Each industry has specific compliance requirements. Ensure you set up the necessary data privacy, security measures, and compliance checks for each industry.

## Custom Field Configurations

Customize fields to capture industry-specific data. For example, in healthcare, you might need fields for patient medical history, while in retail, you might need fields for inventory counts.

## Workflow Customizations

Customize workflows to match industry-specific processes. For example, in delivery & logistics, you might need a workflow for package delivery, while in hospitality, you might need a workflow for guest service requests.
