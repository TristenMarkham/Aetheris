# Setup and Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment, configuring your database, setting environment variables, running your application locally, deploying with Docker and Kubernetes, and considerations for production. 

## System Requirements

- Operating System: Linux/Windows/Mac
- Processor: 1 GHz or faster
- RAM: 2 GB or more
- Disk Space: 20 GB or more
- Internet Connection

## Development Environment Setup

1. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm (comes with Node.js).
2. Install a code editor of your choice, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
4. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Database Configuration

1. Install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) or any database of your choice.
2. Set up your database by running the SQL scripts provided in the `db` directory.
3. Update the `config/db.config.js` file with your database credentials.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
PORT=3000
```

## Running Locally

1. Start your application by running `npm start` in the terminal.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Docker Deployment

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Build your Docker image by running `docker build -t your_image_name .`.
3. Run your Docker container by running `docker run -p 3000:3000 your_image_name`.

## Kubernetes Deployment

1. Install [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/).
2. Create a deployment by running `kubectl create deployment your_deployment_name --image=your_image_name`.
3. Expose your deployment by running `kubectl expose deployment your_deployment_name --type=LoadBalancer --port=3000`.

## Production Considerations

- Use a separate production database.
- Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- Use a load balancer to distribute traffic.
- Set up monitoring and logging.
- Secure your application by using HTTPS and storing sensitive data securely.

## Troubleshooting Guide

- If your application fails to start, check the error logs in the terminal.
- If you are having database issues, ensure that your database server is running and that your credentials are correct.
- If your Docker container fails to run, ensure that your Docker image was built correctly.
- If your Kubernetes deployment fails, ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is running and that your Docker image is available.
