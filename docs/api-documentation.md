    | Code | Message               | Description |
    |------|-----------------------|-------------|
    | 400  | Bad Request           | The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters. |

    ## Rate Limiting

    Rate limiting is applied to all API endpoints. The limit is 1000 requests per hour per authenticated user.

    ## WebSocket Events

    WebSocket events are used for real-time communication between the server and the client.

    ### Event: scheduling.updated

    Emitted when a scheduling event is updated.

    **Payload**

    ```json
    {
        "id": "string",
        "title": "string",
        "start": "string",
        "end": "string"
    }
    ```

    ## File Upload Endpoints

    ### POST /files

    Uploads a file.

    **Request Body**

    ```json
    {

    ```json
    {
        "id": "string",
        "url": "string"
    }
    ```

    (This is a basic example, you would need to repeat this structure for each module and their respective CRUD operations, WebSocket events, etc.)
