This system would interact with the user, understand their needs, and create the necessary modules to meet those needs using AI.\n\nHere's a rough roadmap of how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Needs Assessment:** The AI interacts with the user to understand their specific needs. This would involve asking the user detailed questions about what they're looking to achieve with the program.\n\n2. **Module Design:** Based on the user's feedback, the AI would design a module structure that can meet those needs. This would involve defining what each module will do and how they will interact with each other.\n\n3. **Module Building:** The AI then uses this design to build the modules. This would involve coding the modules and integrating them into the program.\n\n4. **Testing and Iteration:** The AI tests the modules and gets feedback from the user. Based on this feedback, the AI makes necessary adjustments to the modules.\n\n5. **Deployment and Monitoring:** Once the modules are built and tested, the AI deploys them and continuously monitors their performance to ensure they're meeting the user's needs.\n\nWould this approach align with your vision, Tristen? If so, we can start the process by discussing the specific needs you want this program to address.",
