Sure, here are some basic examples of React components for the "Delivery & Logistics" industry. Please note that these are simple components and you'll need to integrate them with your backend services to make them fully functional.

1. Route Optimization Component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export class RouteOptimization extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Route Optimization</h2>
                {/* Add your route optimization logic here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

2. Package Tracking Component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export class PackageTracking extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Package Tracking</h2>
                {/* Add your package tracking logic here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

3. Driver Management Component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export class DriverManagement extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Driver Management</h2>
                {/* Add your driver management logic here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

4. Vehicle Maintenance Component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export class VehicleMaintenance extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Vehicle Maintenance</h2>
                {/* Add your vehicle maintenance logic here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Remember to import these components in your main app component and use them accordingly. Also, you'll need to add the necessary logic and state management according to your application's requirements.
