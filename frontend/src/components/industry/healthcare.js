```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Patient Care Component

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Patient Care Services</h2>
                {/* Include specific details about patient care services here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

// Medical Scheduling Component

// HIPAA Compliance Component

        return (
            <div>
                <h2>HIPAA Compliance Services</h2>

// Equipment Tracking Component

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Equipment Tracking Services</h2>
                {/* Include specific details about equipment tracking services here */}

This is a basic example of how you can structure your components. You would need to replace the comments with the actual content or other components that you want to display. Also, remember to import these components in the files where you want to use them. 

Please note that this code doesn't include any state management, event handling, or API calls. Depending on your application's requirements, you might need to add those as well. 

Also, for HIPAA compliance, you need to ensure that any patient data is handled securely and in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. This is not something that can be handled solely through React components, but would involve your server-side logic, database, and potentially other aspects of your application.
