Below is a basic example of React components for the "Construction" industry. These components are simplified and would need to be expanded upon to meet the specific needs of your application. 

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Project Management Component
export class ProjectManagement extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Project Management</h2>
                {/* Add your project management related content here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

// Equipment Tracking Component
export class EquipmentTracking extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Equipment Tracking</h2>
                {/* Add your equipment tracking related content here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

// Safety Compliance Component
export class SafetyCompliance extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Safety Compliance</h2>
                {/* Add your safety compliance related content here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

// Material Ordering Component
export class MaterialOrdering extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Material Ordering</h2>
                {/* Add your material ordering related content here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Each of these components can be imported and used in other parts of your application. They are currently just placeholders and would need to be filled out with the actual content and functionality you want them to have. 

Remember that React components should be small, reusable pieces of your UI. These components could each be broken down into smaller components depending on the complexity of your application. 

For example, the `ProjectManagement` component might include components like `ProjectList`, `ProjectDetail`, `TaskList`, `TaskDetail`, etc. 

Also, remember to integrate these components with your state management system (like Redux or MobX) and your routing system (like React Router) as needed. 

Finally, ensure that these components meet any compliance requirements your application has. This might include accessibility standards, security standards, or industry-specific standards.
