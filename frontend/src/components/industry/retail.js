```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Store Operations Component
export class StoreOperations extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Store Operations</h1>
        // Add your specific operations here
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Inventory Management Component
export class InventoryManagement extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Inventory Management</h1>
        // Add your specific operations here
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Staff Scheduling Component
export class StaffScheduling extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Staff Scheduling</h1>
        // Add your specific operations here
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Loss Prevention Component
export class LossPrevention extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Loss Prevention</h1>
        // Add your specific operations here
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

This is a basic setup for your components. You can add more functionality to each component as per your requirements. Also, you can use hooks and functional components if you are using a newer version of React. 

Remember to add the necessary import statements at the top of your file for any additional libraries or modules you may use within these components. For example, if you're using Redux for state management, you'll need to import the necessary Redux functions. 

Also, keep in mind to follow the compliance requirements specific to the "Retail Operations" industry when implementing the functionality of these components.
