```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Route Optimization Component
export class RouteOptimization extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Route Optimization</h2>
                {/* Add your route optimization logic here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

// Supply Tracking Component
export class SupplyTracking extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Supply Tracking</h2>
                {/* Add your supply tracking logic here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

// Quality Checklists Component
export class QualityChecklists extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Quality Checklists</h2>
                {/* Add your quality checklists logic here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

// Client Feedback Component
export class ClientFeedback extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Client Feedback</h2>
                {/* Add your client feedback logic here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Please note that the above code is a basic structure of the components. You need to add your own logic for each component based on your requirement. You can replace the comments with your own logic. 

Also, don't forget to import these components in your main component file where you want to use them. You can import them like this:

```jsx
import { RouteOptimization, SupplyTracking, QualityChecklists, ClientFeedback } from './YourComponentFile';
```

Replace 'YourComponentFile' with the name of the file where you have these components.
